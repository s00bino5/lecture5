## I/O Redirection
- Command outputs are displayed on the screen by default. 
- Use `>` to redirect output to a file. The `>>` appends the output to an existing file.

  

## Pipelines
- The pipe (`|`) operator passes the output of one command as input to another, allowing commands to be chained together.

  

## File Permission Changes
- The `chmod` command is used to modify file and directory permissions. 
- Permissions are divided into owner, group, and others, and you can assign specific rights to each.

  

## Superuser Privileges
- Certain operations require administrative or superuser privileges.
- Use `sudo` before a command to execute it with superuser rights. Exit the superuser session using `exit`.

  

## Text Editors
- CLI-based or GUI-based text editors can be used for file editing, with common editors like `nano` being useful.

  

## Command History
- Use the `history` command to view previously executed commands, which can be helpful for reviewing or repeating commands.

  

## Useful Commands:
- `wget`: A command to download files from the internet directly into your working directory.
- `curl`: A versatile tool for fetching and uploading data over the internet.
- `grep`: Searches for text patterns in files using regular expressions with options for case-insensitive search, line numbering, and recursive searching.
